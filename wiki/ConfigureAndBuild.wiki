== Prepare your host environment ==
=== Hardware ===
To work with CanyonLands you will need the following:
 * Board
 * Host machine (Linux Ubuntu 8.x/9.04) with Ethernet card and serial port
 * Serial cable (null-modem)
 * ATX Power supply
 * USB Hub
 * USB Ethernet adapter
 * USB Keyboard & Mouse
 * USB stick
 * Ethernet cross cable or Ethernet Switch/Hub+2 cables
 * Serial ATA HDD or IDE HDD with PCI/PCIe IDE controller
 * PCIe Video adapter (Currently supported are XGI Volari z9s/z9m/z11)
 * VGA cable
 
=== Software ===
As Google we recommend to use Ubuntu 8.04+ , but also you can use CentOS 5.x/RHEL 5.x
 * Install tftp server
 * Install [http://source.android.com/download/using-repo repo] tool 
 * Set up your Linux development environment, make sure you have the following:
Required packages:

{{{
Git 1.5.4 or newer and the GNU Privacy Guard. 
JDK 5.0, update 12 or higher.  Java 6 is not supported, because of incompatibilities with @Override.
flex, bison, gperf, libsdl-dev, libesd0-dev, libwxgtk2.6-dev (optional), build-essential, zip, curl, minicom, tftp-server, uboot-mkimage
}}}
For Ubuntu 32-bit use such command:
{{{
$ sudo apt-get install git-core gnupg sun-java5-jdk flex bison gperf libsdl-dev libesd0-dev libwxgtk2.6-dev build-essential zip curl libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev minicom tftpd uboot-mkimage
}}}

== Configure your network ==
 * Configure your host Ethernet adapter
{{{
sudo ifconfig ethX 10.10.10.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
}}}
 * Configure TFTP-server
/etc/xinet.d/tftpd:
{{{
service tftp
{
protocol        = udp
port            = 69
socket_type     = dgram
wait            = yes
user            = nobody
server          = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
server_args     = /tftpboot
disable         = no
}
}}}
 * Configure NFS server
 TBD

== Checkout sources ==
{{{
$ mkdir ppcdroid
$ cd ppcdroid
$ repo init -u git://gitorious.org/ppcdroid/manifest.git
$ repo sync
}}}

== Build kernel ==
To build kernel the Android compiler should be added into PATH variable:
{{{
$ cd ppcdroid
$ export PATH=$PWD/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/powerpc-linux-4.3.1/bin
}}}

The kernel is located in root of android sources in kernel folder
{{{
$ cd ppcdroid
$ make ARCH=powerpc 44x/canyonlands_android_defconfig
$ make ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-android-linux- uImage 
$ cd arch/powerpc/boot/dts && dtc -I dts -O dtb -o canyonlands.dtb canyonlands.dts
}}}
uImage can be found in `arch/powerpc/boot` folder and device tree blob in `arch/powerpc/boot/dts` folder.

== Build rootfs ==

The next step is Android file system build. To build file system you need to specify for which board you want to build. Currently only Canyonlands platform is supported:
TARGET_PRODUCT=canyonlands.

To build rootfs:
{{{
$ cd ppcdroid
$ make TARGET_PRODUCT=canyonlands -j8
}}}

The number after '-j' is amount of available CPUs on your host system. This can significantly save time 
After build process finished you'll need rootfs for this do following:

{{{ 
$ cd out/target/product/canyonlands
$ mkdir android_rootfs
$ cp -r root/* android_rootfs
$ cp -r system android_rootfs
}}}

{{{
$ sudo ../../../../build/tools/mktarball.sh ../../../host/linux-x86/bin/fs_get_stats android_rootfs . rootfs rootfs.tar.bz2
}}}
